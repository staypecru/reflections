FC - file compare 

It lets me compare files for faster search mistakes. 

I can easily compare old and new version of the same file after changings 
and faster find the difference between them. 



How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

You can compare old versions with last version or even them to each other. It gives you an advantage to find changes.


What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit,
 like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

When you save manually you can choose just right size of changes and you can even add some descriptions to each commit. 
But you can forget to save it and it would be a silly mistake.



Why do you think some version control systems, like Git,
 allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?


Because it allows you to track files together and see the changes beetwen them together.
For example if you create something like button, you will make a changes in html and css file,
and it's a good practice to save them together and describe the commit as "adding a button"




How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

First you use git log to see the all commits and find one which you need to compare; 
Then use git diff with previos (or just different) commit to compare commits and find differences




How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

You can easily checkout every commit and every saved changes you did, so there is no need to worry about mistakes.



Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for? 

To create a repositories for all my future projects to keep them safe and more sustainable.
